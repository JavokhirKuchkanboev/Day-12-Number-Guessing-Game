🧠 Day 12 – Number Guessing Game

100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu
This project is a Number Guessing Game built to practice:
Functions
Local vs. global variables
Scope
Logic building
While loops
Random module
🎯 Project Goal
The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it.
The player can choose a difficulty level:
Easy → 10 attempts
Hard → 5 attempts
After each guess, the game gives feedback:
“Too high”
“Too low”
“You got it!” (Correct guess)
The game ends when the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.
🛠️ What I Practiced
Writing clear functions
Managing game state
Using loops effectively
Conditional logic
Clean code structure
Understanding variable scope
▶️ How to Run
python main.py
📚 Key Concepts Learned
random.randint()
Function structure
Returning values
Using while loops for game flow
